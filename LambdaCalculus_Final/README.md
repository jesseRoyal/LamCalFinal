Lambda Calculus Interpreter Documentation
Overview
This project provides an interpreter for a programming language based on Lambda Calculus. The interpreter supports applicative-order reduction and performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis on input source code. It also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction and can provide detailed explanations of each reduction step using the ChatGPT API.

Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code.
Syntactic Analysis: Parses the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Semantic Analysis and Evaluation: Evaluate the AST using applicative-order reduction.
GUI Interface: Allows users to input Lambda Calculus expressions and see detailed evaluation steps and explanations.
ChatGPT Explanations: Provides additional information about each reduction step
